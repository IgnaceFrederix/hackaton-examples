# InnovatieRoute Hackaton Examples
## Introduction

These 5 labs are examples of what students can build in AWS after attending the *Gluo Infrastructure 2-0 seminar*. Students are always able to choose their own setup to build, these merely suggestions.

This repository can be handed out to the students after the *seminar* as a best practice example. All the labs are explained step by step and tested on a live environment.
